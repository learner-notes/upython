        <h3>Program</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Program is a set of instructions to be followed by the computer which has pre-defined syntax and semantics.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Programming language</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Computers can understand only machine language (0's and 1's ie binary) which is tougher to write  for humans.</li>
          <li>Programming language is  the one which computer and humans can understand at ease. eg.python, c ,c++.</li>
          <li>So program(instructions) are pre-written in programming language & converted to machine language.</li>
          <li>Also computers can process billions of instructions per second while humans are just able to give only few instructions at a second.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Why programming</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Computers can do jobs repeatedly for eternity at high speed without feeling sick of it which humans can never do.</li>
          <li>So we instruct the computer in the language we both can undertand (programmming language) and computer does the difficult jobs for us.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="WHY_PYTHON">
        <h3>Python</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Python has the easiest syntax of the programming languages I know.Trust me, I have seen syntax of java script, c, c++, java, php, python.</li>
          <li>Pyhton is widely popular across the globe and its popularity is ever increasing, so there is a supporting community world-wide.</li>
          <li>Pyhton is used in wide range of applications from web development to machine learning , including iot.</li>
        </ul>
